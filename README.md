# üö® DDoS Script Attack Application

## Overview  
This application is designed to simulate **virtual DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks** on internal networks using three types of user interfaces. Its primary goal is to study how DDoS attacks like **SYN Flood**, **UDP Flood**, and **Slowloris** work, understand their impact, and improve network security.

---

## üéØ Objectives and Impact  
- Develop an application to launch virtual DDoS attacks via multiple interfaces.  
- Understand the mechanics of DDoS attacks and their effects on systems.  
- Identify vulnerabilities in network security and explore mitigation strategies.

## ‚ú® Features  
1. **Three User Interfaces**:  
   - **Web-based**: Built with Python Flask as the backend.  
   - **GUI**: Developed using the Python Tkinter library.  
   - **CLI**: Command-line interaction.  
2. **Core Code**:  
   - Written in Python.  
   - Supports three attack types: SYN Flood, UDP Flood, and Slowloris.  
3. **Network Simulation**:  
   - Uses **GNS3** for virtual network environment simulations.
